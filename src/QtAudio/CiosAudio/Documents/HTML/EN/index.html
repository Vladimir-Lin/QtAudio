              <p class="larger">CIOS Audio Core is a free, cross
                platform and embeddable C++ abstract audio streaming
                interface.&nbsp; It enables you to use simple C++
                program to access audio streamings.&nbsp; The same code
                can run on many platforms, including Windows,
                Unix(ALSA/OSS/Jack), Mac OS X, Android and iPhone OS.</p>
              <p>CIOS Audio Core adapts a pretty simple interface to play or
                record audio.&nbsp; It uses 'Host API' to write the
                underlying audio API on multiple platforms.&nbsp;
                Applications can write the same code and run on all
                platforms, makes handling audio a very easy task.</p>
              <p>Besides regular library(Unix libCaCore.a, Windows
                CaCore.lib),CIOS Audio Core can be embedded into C++
                applications, which is the most encouraged form of CIOS
                Audio Core.&nbsp; There are special no-brainer settings
                for Qt, makes Qt programmers extremely easy to write an
                audio applications.&nbsp; The whole library contains
                only two files(CiosAudio.hpp and CaCore.lib or
                libCaCore.a in Unix).&nbsp; For most audio application
                programmers, CIOS Audio Core is one of the best choices and
                simplest audio interface options.</p>
              <p>CIOS Audio Core was originally designed for
                CIOS Sensor Grid(Collective Intelligence Operating System),
                specifically for audio streaming system.&nbsp; The
                original scheme is rather complicated.&nbsp; The open
                source version of CIOS Audio Core is considered very
                simple and easy, complexity and dependency was greatly
                reduced.&nbsp; The goal is make most of audio code
                completed in 1~10 C++ code.</p>
              <p>Supports FFmpeg.&nbsp; CIOS Audio Core treats
                FFmpeg(and VideoLAN VLC) as an audio input/output
                device, therefore we can use the concept of audio device
                to read and write audio streaming from files.&nbsp; The
                mechanism greatly reduced the complexity of an audio
                file decoding and encoding process.&nbsp; Normal audio
                application programmers do not need to have a great deal of knowledge
                about FFmpeg or VideoLAN VLC to read and write audio
                file formats.<br>
              </p>
              <p>It is strongly encouraged to embed the source code into
                your program rather than using a compiled library(such
                as libCaCore.a and CaCore.lib).&nbsp; All you need to do
                is to pick what you need, and include them into your
                program.&nbsp; Most components are carefully separated
                at the beginning of the design.&nbsp; Most 'Host API'
                will not affect each other, what you need to do is find
                out what need to be included into your C++
                program.&nbsp; If you do not require FFmpeg support, or
                you have your own code on FFmpeg or VLC, just disable
                FFMPEGLIB.&nbsp; The code are very carefully separated.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Also, there are some other programming language
                bindings.&nbsp; Read the documents and find out which
                one is what your need.<br>
              </p>
