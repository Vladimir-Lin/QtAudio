    <h2>Translators</h2>
    <br>
    One best way to help this project is to translate the document.
    Therefore, we hereby sincerely invite you to join the document translation team.
    <br>
    <p><b><i>Portions or partial transations are welcome.</i></b></p2>
    <br>
    <br>
    What we need is not a full translation, we can take any help from anyone who are willing
    to translate portions of the document inside this project.  It is not necessary to
    complete all translations in one-man army.  A few sentences are just fine.
    <br>
